# How to use

**1. Download**
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:SejunKang/babel.git
  ```

**2. Operate `CMAKE` to create the executable file**
After downloading the file, create `build` directory and move into it.
```
cd babel
mkdir build
cd build
```
Type `ccmake ..` and set the `CLHEP` path to `/program/clhep/2.4.7.1/lib/CLHEP-2.4.7.1`. Then press `c` multiple times until **[g] generate** button appears in the Keys window.
Press `g` to confirm the CMAKE settings.
Once the settings are ready, type the following commands to create the executable file `babel`.
```
cmake ..
make
```

**3. Run the simulation**

a. Run in UI mode
```
./babel
```
Push the green start button on the top of the GUI screen to shoot one muon beam. If you want to shoot multiple beams, type `/run/beamOn <number>` in the UI window.

b. Run in batch mode (Horizontal)

I have made two different macro files for horizontal incidence and vertical incidence. To shoot the beam horizontally, use `run_hor.mac`.
```
./cosmu run_hor.mac
```

This will automatically run the simulation without any graphic visualization. To change the number of beams, open `run.mac` and change the number in the line `/run/beamOn <number>`. You must do `make` in the `build` directory after changing anything.
Once the simulation is done, the output ROOT file `output_hor.root` will be generated.

c. Run in batch mode (Vertical)

Vertical incidence is run for 15 different positions on the scintillator: -70 cm, -60 cm, -50 cm, -40 cm, -30 cm, -20 cm, -10 cm, 0 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, 60 cm, 70 cm. Here, the center of the scintillator bar is placed on the origin (0 cm).
Using `run_ver.mac`, the simulation automatically runs the 15 different positions sequentially.

```
./cosmu run_ver.mac
```

Once the simulation is done, the output ROOT file `output_ver.root` will be generated.

**4. Analysis**

By operating the ROOT code `Addup.cc`, you can count the number of photons that reached the PMT for all beam positions.
Also, their Horizontal/Vertical ratios are calculated.

**5. Other important factors**
- If you modify anything of the code, you must do `make` in the `/build` directory.
- If you make a new `.cc` or `.hh` file in the simulation set, or delete the existing file, you must do `cmake ..` before `make`.
- If there are any problems while running the `cmake`, type `ccmake ..` in the `/build` directory and check if all the environment variables are correctly registered. You must also register your Geant4 path in `.bashrc`.
- **Please call me if any other problems happen.**
